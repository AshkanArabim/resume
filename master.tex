		% \item Created data pipeline for fraud detection during payment processing using {Java}, {Spring Boot}, \& {Hibernate}.
		% \item Created fraud detection data pipeline using {Java}, {Spring Boot}, \& {Hibernate}, contributing to projected {23\% reduction in fraud}.
		% note: project 1:
		% note: the internal tool was CODI
		% \item Built 
		% % root-cause-analysis dashboard 
		% alerting pipeline 
		% to detect card service failures \& notify SREs, reducing incident-response time by 
		% % {61\%}. % note: pulled from the presentation
		% {93\%}. % note: reduction from 4 hours to 15 mins
		% \item Reduced incident-response time by {93\%} by building alerting pipeline for card service failure detection.
		\item Built \& deployed anomaly-detection pipeline for Capital One's card decisioning system, notifying SREs of malfunctioning ML models and reducing incident-response time \textbf{from 4+ hours to <15 mins}.
		\item Wrote highly optimized \textbf{Databricks SQL} \& evaluated warehouse sizes to minimize pipeline cost \& latency.
		% \item Partnered with Observe Inc. to provide product feedback on dashboarding and alerting features, influencing vendor roadmap.

		% \item Leveraged internal tools to monitor {Snowflake} data and spot performance anomalies.
		% note: project 2: meh. does anyone really care about a New Relic to Observe migration?
		% note: may want to add the fact that I used Gemini here
		% \item Migrated monitoring dashboards from {New Relic} and {Splunk} to {Observe}, reducing observability fragmentation.
		% \item Centralized observability by writing Python + Gemini script to move dashboards from New Relic to Observe. % note: plan b
		% note: data src for observe vs new relic: https://techcrunch.com/2023/10/05/observability-platform-observe-raises-50m-in-debt-launches-gen-ai-features/
		% \item Slashed team observability cost by >70\%, using Python to move New Relic dashboards to Observe. % note: python is plan b
		
		% note: project 3:
		% \item Streamlined developer experience {Java} library tracking data lineage across card authorization system.
		% note: technically, consumer lineage is more broad. "consumer" just means other teams can use the plugin.
		% note: you could also add Mockito here.
		% note: other tech used: 
		% \item Extended {Java} data lineage plugin to support consumer spending data, improving audit-readiness.
		% \item Extended {Java} data lineage plugin to support consumer spending data though test-driven development with {JUnit}.
		% \item Extended \textbf{Java}-based lineage plugin to log custom data transformations using a YAML specification.
		\item Extended \textbf{Java}-based plugin to log custom \textbf{Apache Spark} data lineage events using a YAML specification. % note: mild plan b
		\item Applied \textbf{test-driven development} using \textbf{JUnit} and \textbf{Mockito} to ensure robust, maintainable code.

		% note: fuck it. just doing plan B is easier.
		% \item Created plugin to log card data transformations using {Java} and {JUnit} test-driven development, improving audit-readiness.
		% \item Created Java logging plugin to add traceability to card data transformations. % note: too vague. too generic.

		% note: databricks sql optimization to resume. from 45 mins to 7 mins
		% note: ^^ but snowflake if you need plan b. the original snowflake was fine. only databricks needed tweaking.
