# My resume!
This is where I host my constantly updating resume. Everything is written in LaTeX (totally recommended btw), so maintaining it is as easy as maintaining code.

**You can download the `master.pdf` file to see my complete CV.**

The original template was written by [@vgnshiyer](https://github.com/vgnshiyer). Gotta say, I'm a huge fan!
