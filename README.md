# My resume!
This is where I host my constantly updating resume. Everything is written in LaTeX (totally recommended btw), so maintaining it is as easy as maintaining code.

## Getting Started
- For my SWE-focused resume, open / download `Ashkan Arabi SWE.pdf`.
- For my AI/ML research-focused resume, open / download `Ashkan Arabi research.pdf`.
- For project-management and administrative stuff, open / download `Ashkan Arabi management.pdf`.
- Or if you want to see my complete CV, you can uncomment everything and compile the tex file.

## Acknowledgement:
The original template was written by [@vgnshiyer](https://github.com/vgnshiyer). Gotta say, I'm a huge fan!
