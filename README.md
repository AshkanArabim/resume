# My resume!
This is where I host my constantly updating resume. Everything is written in LaTeX (totally recommended btw), so maintaining it is as easy as maintaining code.

## Getting Started
- For my SWE-focused resume, open / download `swe.pdf`.
- For my AI/ML research-focused resume, open / download `research.pdf`.
- For project-management and administrative stuff, open / download `management.pdf`.
- Or if you want to see my complete CV, you can uncomment everything and compile the tex file.
